dev upddate 2.0
Some things kinde fucked at this point i heard that 20 players was banned.
And i think i know what is the problem.
And i think its the rundll32.exe what i actully put to idle mode.
But dont worry, i will post another leak somewhere!
Keep  search for the leak i postedit on 15 discord servers.
BTW the new 3.0 going to have the best launcher ever!
Its going to be made with c# and a little bit of .bat files is going with that!
But its going to be easier to have profiles for difrente computer.
fps test:
nvidia mx110 2gb
2.0
60 fps

3.0
117fps butit can lagg sometimes to 60fps but its not big of a deal!

DEV UPDATE

Some server side anticheat will ban you!
But i am working on a better version!
The version is being leaked so you wanna search for it! ;)
BTW the version will contain some fivem fixes and old updates wich was on very old version!
But these will be the best update yo ever played!
